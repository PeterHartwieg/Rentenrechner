/**
 * Policy-default constants for the Mein-Plan sensitivity rows (PR 6).
 *
 * These are **product-policy defaults**, NOT statutory values — they parametrise
 * the "Was sich ändern würde, wenn …" perturbations shown on the Mein-Plan page.
 * Statutory cohort values, contribution caps, tax brackets and similar live in
 * `src/rules/de2026.ts` (year-bound) or `src/rules/legalConstants.ts` (cross-year).
 * Per CLAUDE.md "No statutory values outside `src/rules/`" — the literals here
 * never feed engine math; they only choose which perturbation to compare against
 * the baseline. Each row's effect is rendered through the same combine-mode
 * simulation pipeline as the baseline, so the resulting deltas are
 * always engine-derived, never hand-rolled.
 *
 * Design intent for each constant is paragraph-cited below so a future reader
 * understands why these specific perturbations are surfaced.
